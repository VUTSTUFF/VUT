Safety Concerns 
VUT current state/situation is not good at all, infact i think VUT  itself does not take safety measures because if they did adhere to the rules and safety regulations of a Safe Working Environment there wouldn't be some complains from the Staff.

Here are Some Issues that the staff/workers have with the institution:

*Entrance - there is no proper verification done at the gate, meaning even if you're not a worker of VUT or neither  a student you can easily sneak-in because the securities are not doing job properly.
*The Fence - there are some point of the fence where it had been cut off 
*Light - in the undergroud parking lot & ground floor there are no ligts as a result the staff can easily get mugged
*Lack of Cameras - many buildings in the institution lacks camera to track every movement going on camp and those which have the cameras - those cameras lack quality meaning the footages are not clear

The Ai- Solution can bring about change and safety to the the worker since it will involve the use of biometrics and face recognition for one to enter the premises and as for the installed cameras in the institution buildings they will have an Ai-tool in them that will detect an act of terror and it can also detect ones feeling/emotions this can help notice when on is not feeling well.
